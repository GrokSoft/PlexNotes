Sync Settings

I tried to set up the sync settings on 8/21/16
Used this url: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/synchronizing-and-sharing-settings.html

The problem is that the plugin it tells you to install for this is NOT compatible with the current version of itellij.
We need to wait for them to update it.
