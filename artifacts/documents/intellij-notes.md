# IntelliJ Notes

We use JetBrains IntelliJ to develop PlexNotes. These are the plug-ins,
notes, and tricks that have been used.

 1. Install node.js for your operating system.

 2. Install IntelliJ.
    * Install node.js and AngularJS during IntelliJ installation.

 3. Install the plug-ins below.

## Plug-Ins

Install in this order generally:

- node.js
- AngularJS
- Python
- AngularJS Templates
- File Watchers
- Markdown Support
- Markdown Navigator
- gfm
- Quick Notes
- IDEA Mind Map
- IntelliTail
- .ignore
- UUID Generator

Tweak and fiddle to get the plug-ins and everything happy before
proceeding.

It is highly recommended that you export your settings and any other
customizations such as the Keymap so they may be easily imported if
anything requires IntelliJ to be reinstalled.
